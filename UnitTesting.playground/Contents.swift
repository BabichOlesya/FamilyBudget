import UIKit

// Unit testing

// tests should cover:
// - Core functionality: Model classes and methods and their interactions with the controller
// - The most common UI workflows
// - Boundary conditions
// - Bug fixes


// FIRST - set of criteria for effective unit tests.
// Fast: Tests should run quickly.
// Independent/Isolated: Tests shouldn’t share state with each other.
// Repeatable: You should obtain the same results every time you run a test. External data providers or concurrency issues could cause intermittent failures.
// Self-validating: Tests should be fully automated. The output should be either “pass” or “fail”, rather than relying on a programmer’s interpretation of a log file.
// Timely: Ideally, you should write your tests before writing the production code they test. This is a test-driven development (TDD).
